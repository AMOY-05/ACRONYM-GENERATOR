# ACRONYM-GENERATOR
This is an Acronym Generator using Python programming language. 
How does it work?
Basically, it collect all the first letter that start each word and and join them together to form an Acronym, but the p Robles is that the code have not been able to neglect preposition like on, at, in and so on.
